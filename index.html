          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language
          used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations,
          clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced
          server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to
          add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files
          (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a
          host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
          connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic
          control over them
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
          for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
          for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Client-side JavaScript</em> extends the core language by
            supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
            (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to
            place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as
            mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
            server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
            database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
            another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
            server.

          <h1>JavaScript and Java</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
          different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
          does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
          JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
          basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
          from LiveScript to JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
          declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
          number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
          JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more
          common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
          dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
          individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
          special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
          objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
          have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
          to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
          protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
          parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution
          and type safety. Type safety means, for instance, that you can't cast
          a Java integer into an object reference or access private memory by
          corrupting Java bytecodes. Java's class-based model means that
          programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's
          class inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly coupled
          object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more
          complex than JavaScript programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller,
          dynamically typed languages such as HyperTalk and dBASE. These
          scripting languages offer programming tools to a much wider audience
          because of their easier syntax, specialized built-in functionality,
          and minimal requirements for object creation.

          <h1>Hello World</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Web Console in
          multi-line mode, and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
        </p>
        <code
          >(function(){ "use strict"; /* Start of your code */ function
          greetMe(yourName) { alert('Hello ' + yourName); } greetMe('World'); /*
          End of your code */ })();</code
